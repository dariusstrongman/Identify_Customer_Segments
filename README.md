In this project, we're working with two datasets provided by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions. These datasets contain demographic information about the general population of Germany, as well as customers of a mail-order sales company.

The goal of the project is to explore the relationships between demographic features. We'll be organizing the general population into distinct groups or clusters based on these features. Then, we'll examine how the company's customers are distributed among these clusters. This can provide valuable insights into which segments of the population are more likely to be customers of the company.
