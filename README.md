# Udacity_Identify_Customer_Segments
3rd project in Udacity's Machine Learning course, a part of the Data Science nanodegree program

"In this project, Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. Weâ€™ll look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained."

The datasets used in this project are proprietary and cannot be distributed. They are not included as a part of this repo.
